 * Session-scoped cache for the public product catalog.
 *
 * Before this, every storefront surface (each category page, each home section,
 * search, mobile grid) opened its own unbounded `onSnapshot` over the whole
 * products collection. With ~350 active products a single category page view
 * cost ~1000 document reads and held listeners open. The free tier is 50k
 * reads/day, so roughly 47 page views exhausted it.
 *
 * A storefront catalog does not need to be realtime - a shopper does not care
 * that a new bangle appeared without a refresh. So we read once, share the
 * result across every consumer, and re-read only after TTL or an admin write.
 *
 * Where the catalog comes from: a JSON snapshot of the active products, served
 * from the CDN (see `publish-catalog` in api/media.ts), costs no Firestore reads
 * at all. Even reading once per visitor, ~600 documents each, would cap the site
 * at about 80 visitors a day on the free plan. If the snapshot can't be loaded
 * the catalog is read from Firestore as before, so the site keeps working.
 *
 * Admin screens deliberately bypass this and keep using getAllProducts().

 * revalidates with If-None-Match and the CDN answers 304 with no body unless
